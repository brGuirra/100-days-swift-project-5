## 💁🏽‍♂️ Overview

This app is a word game that deals with anagrams.

## ⚙️ How it works


The app presents a word and the user has to type words that can
be create containg the letters of the game's started word.

The answer typed by the user needs to have at least three letters,
can't be the equal to the game's started word, can't be repeated and has to
be misspeled correctly in English.

The user is able to restart the game to get a different word to play anytime.
